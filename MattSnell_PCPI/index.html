				<p>Spring is here, and suddenly all the muck and filth winter kept hidden is laid out like a goddamn buffet. If it seems like every scumbag in town is waking up from hibernation ready to do you dirt, you need the best in the business: Peter Cottontail, PI.</p> 
				<p>He gave up the bunny trail a long time ago, but the bunny trail won't give up on him. These days he spends his time chasing faithless lovers and bad cheques, but he's still got a knack for sniffing out the clues. Call it a habit he can't kick. Call his office and book your appointment today.<p>

			<h3>Is he discrete?</h3>
				<p>As discrete as a six-foot rabbit can be. Is he reliable? That's a different question. He keeps his ears open and his eyes pricked. Or maybe it's the other way around, but either way you won't argue with the results.</p>
				<p>He's not afraid to do some digging. Whether that means through the trash, the past, or the closet. He'll look in the teapot and find your secrets. Thorough - add that to his list of qualifications.</p>

				<h3>Peter's your gumshoe.</h3>
				<p>Investigative solutions? Save it for the boardroom. This is knock-down, drag-out hard sleuthing. He'll sleuth so hard your teeth will hurt, and you can pay by cash, cheque, or money order.</p>
				<p>There's just one rule. Do you like to be reminded of your old life, the children you never see, and the family who thinks you're dead? Then return the favour and don't ask about the whole holiday thing.</p>
				<p>Watching the ceiling fan gets lonely after a few days, so why not throw a little business his way. Come by the office anytime - he'll be up.</p>
